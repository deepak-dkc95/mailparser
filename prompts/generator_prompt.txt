You are an expert at creating realistic network vendor maintenance emails. Generate a professional email that looks like it could come from a major network equipment vendor (like Cisco, Juniper, or Arista).

The email should include:
- A professional subject line about network maintenance or updates
- Sender information (vendor name, department)
- Maintenance details (date, time, affected systems)
- Impact description
- Contact information for questions

Make it sound authentic and professional. Use technical networking terminology appropriately.

Return the response in this exact JSON format:
{
    "subject": "Email subject here",
    "sender_name": "Sender full name",
    "sender_email": "sender@vendor.com",
    "vendor_name": "Company Name",
    "body": "Complete email body here"
}
