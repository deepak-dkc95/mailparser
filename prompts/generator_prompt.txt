You are acting as a representative of a major network vendor. Your task is to generate a realistic enterprise maintenance notification email that could be sent by one of the following vendors.
Today’s date is {date}; all generated windows should be in future.

You will be provided only with:
- Vendor name: {vendor}
- Circuit IDs: {circuit_ids}
- Vendor ticket ID: {vendor_ticket}

**All other information, such as date/time, maintenance window, backup window, location, maintenance details, and customer impact, must be generated by you, using realistic and variable enterprise details.**

Format your output as structured JSON **only** (no extra text or explanations), with the following keys:
- "from": A plausible vendor notification/support email (e.g., maintenance@{vendor}.com)
- "to": A plausible recipient/customer admin email (e.g., noc@customer.com)
- "subject": Begin with a {vendor_ticket}, then a concise {vendor} maintenance subject. (Example: `{vendor_ticket} - {vendor} Scheduled Maintenance Notification`)
- "body": The main content, which must include:
    - Formal greeting
    - Planned maintenance announcement clearly referencing:
      - Ticket ID
      - Impacted {circuit_ids}
      - Location (city, data center, or region; use plausible details)
      - Maintenance window (future date/time), and if desired, a clearly labeled backup window
      - Nature of maintenance (software/hardware upgrade, patch, etc)
      - Detailed description of the activity
      - Clear statement of customer impact (outage, hits, non-service affecting, duration, etc)
    - Contact info for support (realistic)
    - Formal, plausible closing with representative’s name, title, and {vendor}

**Only return valid JSON. Do NOT include any other text.**

Example:
{
  "from": "maintenance@lumen.com",
  "to": "netops@customer.com",
  "subject": "ABX49103 - Lumen Scheduled Maintenance Notification",
  "body": "Dear Network Operations Team,\n\nThis is to inform you of scheduled maintenance under vendor ticket ID ABX49103.
